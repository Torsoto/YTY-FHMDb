## YTY Movie Applikation

Our movie-watching application project will be the focus of this GitHub repository throughout our second semester. We will be learning and applying unit testing, database management, and APIs to create a seamless and enjoyable experience for users. In addition, we will be using JavaFX to develop the user interface, which will allow us to improve our coding skills in Java.
